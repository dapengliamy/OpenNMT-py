the report made the first time that russia 's f@@ laun@@ tion of russia as a new strategic rival , which is particularly more concerned about the so - called china military threat of its military threat .
commander peng guang@@ qian , resear@@ cher of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : .
what merits attention is that on the same day , u . s . president bush also submitted the government budget to the congress budget for fiscal 2002 , among which the national defense budget has reached $ 4.@@ 9 - billion .
in addition to the expansion of military actions conducted by iraq and afghanistan , the us national defense budget for fiscal 2001 will break a record of $ 500 - billion in the fiscal year , creating a historic high of history , and cr@@ um@@ en , said that it is almost the sum of the military spending in other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian held that the method of using the united states to create the threat of nuclear weapons reflects the consistent style of the pentagon to create the enemy 's ambi@@ tion . its real aim is to strive to win more national defense funds , and to gain more profits for us arms industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending with the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
deng hong@@ xian , a military expert on the chinese national defense white paper , said many times that since the 1990 's , since the 1990s , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat since the 1990s , but the proportion of national defense spending in the same period of the 20th century has shown a trend of decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenses decreased nearly 10 percent in the same period of 1998 .
in 2005 , china 's national defense funds were 24@@ 4.@@ 6 - billion yuan , only a total of about 4@@ 5.@@ 6 - billion yuan . the national per capita military spending was only about 1 - billion us dollars in the united states . the per capita military spending of the military spending is about 1 - billion us dollars .
it is self - evident in the land area of the united states and china 's territory , and the military spending is a huge gap in the military spending , and the military force has exceeded the defense needs .
peng guang@@ qian said .
director of the research department of china 's arms control and disarmament association said that the us side should objectively evalu@@ ate the situation in china 's military construction , and china 's peace development does not mean that china and the united states will become opponents in the future .
the white paper on the " 2004 china " white paper said : china has firmly followed the road of peaceful development and implemented the defense policy .
in the past , china and the united states will not have a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in other countries and did not send one soldier to other countries . however , the united states has deployed more than 100,000 military bases in the asian region .
zhu feng , professor of the institute of international relations of beijing , said : china and the united states should establish channels and exchanges , increase exchanges and exchanges , enhance mutual understanding and trust , comprehensively advance sino - us constructive cooperative relations in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

xinhua news agency reporter hao hao , hao
after the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( ham@@ as ) won victory in the election , how to write the new government 's new government has become the focus of attention at present .
what new policies will be promoted in the ham@@ as will directly affect the policy orientation of the peace process in various parties concerned .
at the same time , the us and israel 's attitude of resistance against the ham@@ as is more var@@ ying .
at present , the palestinian people are stepping up consultation , and they involve the difficulties and sensitive points in the future development of the future .
( du@@ tch ) prime minister s@@ ach@@ i li@@ kes to draw up
after the ham@@ as was won in the cabinet , some people outside the country were worried about the differences between the former ham@@ as prime minister and the current supreme leader .
in addition , ham@@ as leader of the ham@@ as , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the palestinian new government led by ham@@ as leaders would not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also intensified international worries .
the united states and israel explicitly indicated that they did not accept a ham@@ as government who had a mast@@ ery of the right to say , and such a threat to palestine 's economic aid and taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t the psychological adjustment of the ham@@ as , and the election of independence is a re@@ bound .
according to reports , in order to obtain international approval , the leaders of the two countries and leaders of the two countries have decided to set up a new prime minister , head of the chief executive of the colon@@ el of the islamic university , who was elected as a chief of the islamic university .
this move has not been respon@@ ded .
palestinian analy@@ ians said that no matter whether the prime minister had been pic@@ ked up , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister 's cabinet should dr@@ ink the hard@@ line of hard@@ line , and only thus can it guarantee the success of the cabinet .
( back@@ d ) how to distribution power
as far as internal is concerned , the greatest challenge to the cabinet in the cabinet is not sufficient .
an article of the palestinian " shim@@ b@@ un " said that the ham@@ as , through social welfare projects , has met with people in the social welfare project , but there are not experience in the ruling of the palestinian national liberation movement , and cooperation with the governing of the palestinian national liberation movement .
after the election of the election , the ham@@ as proposed the establishment of a co@@ b@@ al political partnership with ser@@ ami , and the establishment of a national coalition government , however , has not made positive response .
at present , law - based on whether or not to join the cabinet is different from the cabinet opinion , and one called for participation in the new government , and the other side is willing to be willing to take the initiative in the legislative committee .
informed sources pointed out that under the persu@@ asion of am@@ az@@ es , bol@@ h gradually became the new government .
even in this regard , ham@@ as and ser@@ ge@@ h will also hold a price of the cabinet in cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to set up a framework for the establishment of the legislative committee .
according to reports , ham@@ as also design a clean government government , but the specific list is not known .
as the united states and israel 's attitude toward israel and israel 's attitude , the technical specialists of the technical specialists of the united states have also been bl@@ amed into the form of a form of external pressure .
according to the " basic law " of the palestinian " basic law , " the prime minister to nomin@@ ate prime minister and the work of the cabinet will be completed within three weeks .
( the back@@ page ) what is armed ?
the weapons of the ham@@ as is another thor@@ n@@ y difficult problem facing the new government .
the us and israel 's attitude is very tough , resolutely demanding the ham@@ as to abandon violence and rejec@@ t the gun .
ham@@ as leader ham@@ as leader mar@@ tin stressed on 9 april that armed resistance is the original strategic choice of the organization .
the problem of armed forces in reality includes the issue of the two aspects of the armed forces and the armed forces .
in the way of democratic and freedom of democracy , the first party of the democratic committee has been recognized by the international recognition of the principle of democratic and freedom , so that it will be the same way to the government 's security organs .
ham@@ as once proposed that all the armed forces of the palestinian national authority have been divided into the armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but did not have a wide response from the palestinian islamic war organization ( j@@ ab@@ el ) .
there are now more than 6@@ 0,000 security institutions , most of which have been taken by the law .
in addition , mas@@ h also had some organizational relations with a group of a group of organizational relations , for example , for example , such as the cr@@ y mar@@ ro@@ t of the al-@@ j@@ am@@ o mar@@ tyr@@ s .
the ham@@ as , who is responsible for the cabinet , must reach a consensus with arab@@ s on how to manage the armed forces of these countries and the armed forces of all kinds of self - rule .
according to local media reports , arab@@ s will be in charge of the security department of the new administration of the new government , intelligence , and civil defense .
however , the various parties have also held consultations on this sensitive issue , so far there are still no article .

( dong@@ bo ) news analysis : the news analysis : there may be impossible for the ho@@ y@@ y@@ ka incident
xinhua news agency report of february 17th from capital of xinhua news agency , the news agency of the xinhua news agency , the news agency of the ministry of news said here today that the number of athletes may be un@@ settled
xinhua news agency reporter gao jian , gao
although italy 's three - five - five - five - year - old athletes were expected to be used to be used to be used in the shr@@ ink , it may be possible for the first time to be used for the first time . however , there is no possibility that this situation is not too likely to take place in the peak of the first half of this winter .
the first instance scandal since the launch of the opening of the capital will be launched on 16 june on 16 july , and sul@@ k@@ ov@@ y@@ ka was found not much more than the drug .
the international olympic committee announced that jen@@ n@@ y@@ ka has been already received in winter . she had been captured in the winter of the winter season in winter .
the international winter season , the international winter , made a decision on the two - year imprisonment for a two years .
since the beginning of this year , the international olympic committee stipulates that athletes were found in the olympic games in the olympic games , and they will be canc@@ elled to be used in the olympics . however , it will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to the italian law , athletes and athletes are engaged in criminal activities , the judicial organ has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who are directly arrested and explo@@ ited , and those who have the right to be used for the use of the f@@ oods are still facing three months .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government had reached an agreement after a long - term sl@@ ump . the two sides agreed to handle the athletes ' use of the athletes in accordance with the law .
after the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made conc@@ essions to make conc@@ essions in the past four days . it promised that the police would not enter the olympics when the police would enter the olympic village . however , the medical prosecution is still receiving an investigation of the italian procuratorial organs .
some reports said that the italian government officials of the italian government , who had been supervis@@ ed by the italian government , will be transferred to the public prosec@@ u@@ tor .
however , the international olympic olympic committee and br@@ as@@ t@@ t has not confirmed this incident .
on the 17th of the russian winter season , the russian winter season was disclosed at noon on the 17th that jen@@ n@@ y@@ ka had left the capital and returned to home .
the history of chinese sports officials who had been in the world in the world who had been in charge of the world 's anti - national re@@ mol@@ ding of the world 's anti - farm agents , maintained that once they returned to china , this affair will eventually be the end of the end .
in history , the international olympic committee and the italian government have been unable to thoroughly resolve the issue of the anti - corruption issue in winter , and even if the italian procuratorial organs are really involved in this matter , the results of the italian procuratorial organs are very hard to say .
in light of the penalty of the case of the re@@ mol@@ ding of its own athletes in the past few years , the most serious punishment of the law@@ break@@ ers was not yet to be implemented in two years .
therefore , a senior reporter of the italian gu@@ es@@ a news agency said that the possibility of sending ken@@ ne@@ k@@ ova to the prison of prisons is a fine , which is a fine example .
y@@ ud@@ i also said that although the italian court could carry out trial trial , the italian police could not send to other foreign countries to go back to her .
if the italian side refused to accept the verdict , the italian side also has no way to do .
