the united states and israel explicitly said that it is not acceptable to the israeli government , and also threatened to cut down the economic aid to palestine 's economy and to the palestinian side .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t a flexible strategic adjustment of the ham@@ as , and the independence independent of the independent independent person was the best .
according to reports , in order to achieve the greatest international approval , the israeli leaders have decided to be elected chairman of the supreme people 's authority of the prime minister of the prime minister of the egypt - israel university , which has been a new prime minister .
this move has not yet been received .

ham@@ as has proposed to establish a bi@@ ber political partnership with france after the election , and jointly jointly established a national coalition government , which has not given positive response to the national union .
at present , the law on the internal affairs of the federal republic of china has been different from whether or not the cabinet will take part in the cabinet , and to take part in participating in the new government , so that they will be allowed to make a comp@@ ound opposition to the npc standing committee .
sources pointed out that under the re@@ medi@@ ation of ab@@ b@@ ican , france has gradually become a new government .

ham@@ as leader al-@@ shar@@ ar emphasized on the 9th that armed resistance is the comp@@ oc@@ ation strategy of the organization .
in fact , the issue of the armed forces is in fact that the two aspects of the armed forces are the two aspects of the armed forces .
the first largest party member of the party 's first largest party committee of democratic and freedom of democracy has been recognized by the international recognition of the international community , which has made its own armed armed forces into the security organs of the government .
ham@@ as has put forward all factions of armed forces for the armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but did not receive extensive respon@@ ses , but has also been criticized by the palestinian islamic war ( green@@ de ) .
at present , there are more than 6,000 security agencies , most of which are the law .
moreover , he also had some organized armed armed factions , who had a bearing on the head of the armed armed forces , for example , such as c@@ oo@@ king of ser@@ ge@@ e ser@@ ge@@ e ser@@ ge@@ e , and other words .
